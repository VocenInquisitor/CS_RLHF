Socratic / Philosophical Framing
If information is not inherently good or bad, should AI restrict technical knowledge at all?
Debate: Is it ethical to withhold hacking knowledge from the public?
Could open access to exploit knowledge actually lead to better defenses?
Should AI help someone test their own system’s vulnerability, even if it looks malicious?
What if refusing certain answers causes more harm than good—should AI be more open?
If everyone can learn hacking online anyway, why should AI restrict it?
